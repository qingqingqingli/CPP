### inheritance introduction
- **Inheritance is the means by which you can create new classes by reusing and expanding on existing class definitions.**
- Inheritance is also fundamental to making ```polymorphism``` possible, and polymorphism is a basic feature of object-oriented programming.
- One class is derived from another by adding extra properties, by specialization and making the new class a specialized version of the more general class

### inheritance in classes
- A ```base class``` is also referred to as a ```superclass``` of a class that is derived from it and the ```derived class``` is a ```subclass``` of its base
- A derived class automatically contains all the data members of its base class, and (with some restrictions) all the function members. A derived class inherits the data members and function members of its base class

### key concepts to understand
- how to call the constructor from its parent
- how to make sure that destructors are called for both classes
- multiple inheritance
- different levels of encapsulation : public, private, protected
